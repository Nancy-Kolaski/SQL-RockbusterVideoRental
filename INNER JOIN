# INNER JOIN

--TOP 10 COUNTRIES
--This query finds the top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers (using GROUP BY and ORDER BY, following JOIN). For this, we would have to use the country table and customer table, however there were no direct links. Using my Lucid chart ERD, I could see the links as follows: (A)customer table ->(B)address table->(C)city table-> (D)country table
--customer_id given alias 'number_of_customers' from customer table. Then, I used INNER JOIN to join all of the tables together following the syntax for A through D (to link all 4 tables),since we only need a limited amount of info from this query.  I grouped by country and ordered by desc in order to see the highest ranks for the top 10, and used limit 10 because we only need top 10.  The following 2 queries build from this first INNER JOIN

select D.country,
COUNT (A.Customer_id) AS number_of_customers
from customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = b.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id =C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
Group by D.country
order by number_of_customers desc
limit 10



--TOP 10 CITIES WITHIN TOP 10 COUNTRIES

select C.city, D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS number_of_customers
from customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
where D.country IN
	(select country
	From customer A
	INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
	Group by D.country
	order by COUNT (a.customer_id) desc
	limit 10)
group by C.city, D.country
order by number_of_customers desc
Limit 10;




--TOP 5 CUSTOMERS FROM THE TOP 10 CITIES WHO'VE PAID THE HIGHEST TOTAL AMOUNTS TO ROCKBUSTER

select A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country,
	SUM (E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
	From customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
	
where C.city IN
	(select city
	From customer A
	INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
	Group by C.city
	order by COUNT (A.customer_id) desc
	limit 10)
